# 🛒 Ecommerce Backend – Version 1

This repository contains **Version 1 (V1)** of an ecommerce backend project.

At the time this version was developed, it was built based on the knowledge and experience I had then.  
The main focus of V1 was on implementing core features and making the system functional, rather than on clean architecture, scalability, or long-term maintainability.

As a result, this version has clear areas for improvement in terms of structure, code cleanliness, separation of concerns, and overall architecture.

> Version 2 development will start soon.

## ⚠️ Important Note

This repository does **not fully represent my current skill level**.  
Instead, it reflects an earlier stage of my learning journey.

Version 2 will demonstrate a more mature, structured, and engineering-focused approach to backend development.
